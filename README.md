A fully modular, working, and extendable simulation environment for multi-location inventory management, built with `gymnasium`.
Accepts random distributions for demand and lead times, user-inputted costs and provides visualizations and summary metrics.
Sample DRL algorithms implemented that can be fully extended with custom implementations or other algorithms from `stablebaselines3`.
